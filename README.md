# Helpful Guides

## How to Setup the Command Line
(Windows users: it is assumed you already have the [MinGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/) shell)

1. Download the [Github Client](https://cli.github.com/).
1. You should now be able to use the `gh` commands. Try the following in the `cmd` shell (`Terminal` for Mac users):
	```
	$ gh --version
	```
	You should get something like:
	```
	gh version 2.13.0 (2022-06-22)
	https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v2.13.0
	```
1. To gain authentication, you need a personal access token, which can be obtained by running the following command in the `cmd` shell (`Terminal` for Mac users):
	```
	$ gh auth token
	```
	Follow the instructions and login with your Github credentials. For more info, see a more detailed [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
1. Now you should be able to run your `Bash` shell in your cloned repository and use commands like:
	```
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "..."
	$ git push origin master
	```
	Note that for Windows users, these commands will be in `MinGW` and for Mac users, in `Terminal`.
